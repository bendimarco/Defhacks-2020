# Defhacks-2020: MedNet

MedNet is a web application that we made to address two major issues in modern healthcare: a lack of interoperability (transfer of data between disparate health systems) and a lack of physical equipment for workers. Because different hospitals use different electronic health records and health worker registries (HWRs), it is often impossible for hospitals to exchange health data that would be very useful for testing and communication purposes. We are aware of this problem, so we wanted to give MedNet users the ability to link their HWR and automatically connect their workers to the system, preventing the need to manually write data to a worker database. Furthermore, in the age of COVID-19 especially, personal protective equipment (PPE) such as respirators, ventilators, and masks are being used at an extraordinarily high rate, which inspired us to create a system that connects hospital departments in need of equipment to hospitals with resources to provide.
